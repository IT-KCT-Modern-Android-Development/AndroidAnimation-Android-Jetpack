# AndroidAnimation-Android-Jetpack 🎉📱

Welcome to the repository for the AndroidAnimation Android application built using Jetpack Compose! This app is a simple animation application that demonstrates the use of animation components in Jetpack Compose. It's a fun and interactive way to explore the capabilities of Jetpack Compose. 😄🚀

## Features 🎯

- **State and Animation**: The `HomePage` composable uses mutable states to control the color, size, and visibility of a box. It also animates these changes using `animateColorAsState` and `animateDpAsState`.
- **Interactive Elements**: The `HomePage` includes buttons that allow the user to interact with the box. These buttons can change the color, size, and visibility of the box.
- **Visibility Animation**: The visibility of the box is animated using `AnimatedVisibility`, providing a smooth transition when the box is shown or hidden.
